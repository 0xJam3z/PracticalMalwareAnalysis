Lab 3-1

1. What are this malware's imports and strings?

Although this file is packed, strings reveals a call for kernel32.dll and gives a lot of information on how this malware is about to execute.
Right above kernel32.dll is a call for ExitProcess and proceeding kernel32.dll is ws2_32. We further see a CONNECT %s %i HTTP/1.0 which is indicative of
a server HTTP/80 request. This alone is valuable in knowing this process is going to call out to the beacon. Late in the strings printout we see registry keys
being created most notably the 'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run' which indicates some file will be running at startup. www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com
is enumerated in the strings output, and though I suspect this is the beacon to grab another file, we'll run procmon, process explorer, apdateDNS, regshot, and iNetSim to capture
what's actually going on.

2. What are the malware's host-based indicators?

After running the malware immediately procmon shows a CreateFile to 'C:\Windows\system32\vmx32to64.exe.' Process Explorer shows a mutant created '\BaseNameObjects\WinVMX32'
Regshot also shows the attempt at creating a run value in '/Run/VideoDrivers/' which auto executes this new file at boot.
Navigating to file and comparing hashes with Lab3-01.exe, we find that they are the same. Network indicators show that in intervals
of 30 seconds to 1 minute the process reaches out to it's command and control center www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com.


3. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so, what are they?

ApateDNS captured the call out to www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com.

Final overview:

My analysis indicates this malware is just attempting to duplicate itself to allow persistence until the beacon decides to take control of the machine.
Giving all of the details with the simple dynamic analysis tool layout we are able to restore the machine back to full functionality as it was a
very lightweight piece of malware. From my assessment this is a remote access trojan with persistence.
