Lab 3-4

1. What happens when you run this file?

The file deletes itself which in procmon we can see "C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe" /c del C:\Docu~1\myname\Lab03-04.exe >> NUL",
but before doing so procmon shows it creating a new cmd.exe in C:\Windows\system32

2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?

After the new CreateFile cmd.exe the file deletes itself. I'd theorize this problem set requires a bit of reverse engineering
to stop the file from deleting itself and forcing it to execute to the next step.

3. Are there any other ways to run this program?

Running strings & PEView SECTION .data we come across -cc, -re, -in and for the purpose of this course I went ahead and went to the newly created
cmd and tried running this file with all 3 commands on the tail end to no avail. As the book states, we will come back to this problem in Lab 9.
